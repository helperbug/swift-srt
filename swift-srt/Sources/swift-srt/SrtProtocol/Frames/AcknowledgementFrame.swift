/// Acknowledgment (ACK) control packets are used to provide the delivery status of data packets. By acknowledging the reception of data packets up to the acknowledged packet sequence number, the receiver notifies the sender that all prior packets were received or, in the case of live streaming, preceding missing packets (if any) were dropped as too late to be delivered.
///
/// There are several types of ACK packets:Â¶
/// A Full ACK control packet is sent every 10 ms and has all the fields of Figure 14.
/// A Light ACK control packet includes only the Last Acknowledged Packet Sequence Number field. The Type-specific Information field should be set to 0.
/// A Small ACK includes the fields up to and including the Available Buffer Size field. The Type-specific Information field should be set to 0.
/// The sender only acknowledges the receipt of Full ACK packets (see Section 3.2.8).
/// The Light ACK and Small ACK packets are used in cases when the receiver should acknowledge received data packets more often than every 10 ms. This is usually needed at high data rates. It is up to the receiver to decide the condition and the type of ACK packet to send (Light or Small). The recommendation is to send a Light ACK for every 64 packets received.
